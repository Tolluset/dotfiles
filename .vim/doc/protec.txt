                                                Last change: 2010 Jan 12.

SYNOPSIS						*protec-synopsis*
>
	" in your .vimrc
	let g:protec_readonly_paths = "~/importants/*"
	let g:protec_nomodifiable_paths = '~/veryimportants/**'

DESCRIPTION						*protec-description*

Plugin for enabling 'readonly' or disabling 'modifiable' automatically, when
opening files in specified paths.  This plugin has no effects until you
declare proper variables.  See |protec-settings| for detail.

DEPENDENCIES						*protec-dependencies*

{only available when your VIM has the |+autoload| feature}

PROVIDES						*protec-provides*

Commands:
:ReProtect
	Activate your configuration with global variables.  See
	|protec-settings|.

Augroups:
protec
	All of the autocmds provided by this plugin is located in "protec".
	To disable in a certain instance of VIM, hit the following command: >

		:autocmd! protec

SETTINGS						*protec-settings*

Variables:
g:protec_readonly_paths
	Paths to execute ":set readonly".  A String, a List or a Dictionary
	can be specified.
	With a String, use "," to set more than one value: >

		let g:protec_readonly_paths = '$VIM/**, ~/repos/tags/**'
<
	With a List, it is convenient to use |line-continuation| for
	readability, regulating: >

		let g:protec_readonly_paths = [
		                \    '$VIM/**',
		                \    '/home/mymaster/opened/**',
		                \ ]
<
	With a Dictionary, same as a List but keys are ignored, so it's handy
	to give a comprehensive lable: >

		let g:protec_readonly_paths = {
				\   'VIM distribution': '$VIM/**',
		                \   'Ruby library':     'C:/Ruby/lib/**',
				\ }
<
	Note that when this plugin is sourced and execute ":ReProtect",
	configuration become effective.  So restart VIM after defining the
	variable in your .vimrc, or hit ":ReProtect" after changing a value of
	this.

g:protec_nomodifiable_paths
	Same as "g:protec_readonly_paths" but paths to execute ":set
	nomodifiable".
