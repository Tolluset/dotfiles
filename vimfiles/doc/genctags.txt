DESCRIPTION						*genctags-description*

Plugin for generating the file "tags" that includes tag information, by
|ctags| program.  This plugin aims to generating a general one simply, so use
"ctags" command directly to specify various options finely.

DEPENDENCIES					*genctags-dependencies*

This plugin require following autoload file.

autoload/jwlib/shell.vim
http://github.com/januswel/dotfiles/blob/master/vimfiles/autoload/jwlib/shell.vim

Additionally, external command "ctags" is required.
	http://ctags.sourceforge.net/

PROVIDES						*genctags-provides*

Mappings:
<Leader>gc or <Plug>GenerateCtags
	Generate tags for the current working directory.  "tags" is located in
	the current working directory.

Commands:
:GenerateCtags[!] {dir}[ {dir1} ...]
	Generate tags for {dir}.  "tags" is located in the current working
	directory.
	With {dir1} and other following arguments, these are treated as
	excluded files or directorys.  Use when there is something not to
	wanna include.
	With bang ("!"), search recursively.

	Note that the end of each argument is "\", VIM interprets it as an
	escape character (specifically look out in win32 environment).  E.g.
	there is one space between {dir} and {dir1}, and "\" exists at the end
	of {dir}, then the command is treated as {dir} and {dir1} is joined
	with a space like "{dir} {dir1}".  In order to avoid this trap, just
	specify a bare name of a directory.

DISABLES						*genctags-disables*

Variables:
g:loaded_genctags
	When exists, does nothing.  Use to disable this plugin.

	may have an affect on mappings of other plugins.  Use
